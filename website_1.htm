  <h3>Information on Birds</h3>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" class="info">
    Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves,
    characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
    a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight
    skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee
    hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living
    species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have
    wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without
    wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs,
    gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss
    of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island
    species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted
    for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds
    and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.

  <h3>Information on Dogs</h3>
  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" class="info">
    The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus
    familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a domesticated carnivore
    of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most
    widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are
    sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
    first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.
    The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred
    over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
